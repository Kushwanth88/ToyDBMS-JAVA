This repository contains a Java program that serves as a toy database management system (DBMS). The program takes queries from the cs20b050_table and produces intermediate code, which is stored in the intermediateCode.txt file. The program also generates dummy data that aligns with the attribute types present in the table.
And create a seperate file for each table created in cs20b050_table.query.
